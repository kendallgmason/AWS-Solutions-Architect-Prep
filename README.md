## Example: EC2 Lab
📌 **What I learned:**  
- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud → virtual servers on demand.  
- Pricing models: On-Demand, Reserved, Spot, Dedicated.  
- Security groups act like virtual firewalls.  

🛠 **What I did:**  
1. Launched a t2.micro EC2 instance in the AWS Free Tier.  
2. Connected via SSH.  
3. Terminated the instance safely.
